Cookie Clicker Site Automation

This is an exploration into site automation through the cookie clicker site (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
I started through Selenium/Python, then very early on I switched to Cypress. This is where the majority of work towards this project was done.
I found Cypress to fight me on making an auto clicker and I took that as a challenge and made it. To get the auto clicker to work I had to remove several calls from the log (for performance reasons), this is why the cypress log, besides one handled error, will be devoid of anything for a majority of the time.  
Hope you find this as cool as I did.
