Cookie Clicker Site Automation

This is an exploration into site automation through the cookie clicker site.
I started through Selenium/Python, then very early on I switched to Cypress. This is where the majority of work towards this project was done.
I found Cypress to fight me on making an auto clicker and I took that as a challenge and made it. To get the auto clicker to work I had to remove several calls from the console (for performance reasons) and create a couple recursive functions. 
Hope you find this as cool as I did.
